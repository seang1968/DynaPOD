### Technical Summary and Explanation for Trapping `Ctrl+C`

#### Overview
In the menu-driven Python application, a requirement was identified to allow users to interrupt their current activity within any menu and return to the main menu using the `Ctrl+C` keyboard combination. This was achieved by integrating a global keyboard listener that detects `Ctrl+C`, gracefully exits the current menu loop, and redisplays the main menu without terminating the application.

#### Key Techniques Used

1. **Global Keyboard Listener**:
   - **Library Used**: The `keyboard` library was used to set up a global hotkey listener. This library can detect keyboard events at a low level, allowing us to register key combinations like `Ctrl+C`.
   - **Hotkey Registration**: The hotkey (`Ctrl+C`) was registered at the initialization of the `MenuManager` class. This ensures that the program listens for the key combination as soon as it starts.

   ```python
   keyboard.add_hotkey('ctrl+c', self.trigger_exit_to_main_menu)
   ```

   This line registers `Ctrl+C` as the hotkey and associates it with the `trigger_exit_to_main_menu` method, which sets a flag to indicate that the user wants to return to the main menu.

2. **Flag-Based Control Flow**:
   - **Flag for Returning to Main Menu**: A boolean flag `exit_to_main_menu` was introduced in the `MenuManager` class. This flag is set to `True` when `Ctrl+C` is detected.
   
   ```python
   self.exit_to_main_menu = True
   ```

   The flag is then checked in the `display_menu` method to determine whether the user wants to return to the main menu. If the flag is set, the method exits the current loop and returns control to the main loop in `main.py`.

3. **Graceful Interruption Handling**:
   - **Try-Except Block**: The `input()` function, which usually waits for user input, is wrapped in a try-except block to catch `KeyboardInterrupt` exceptions that are raised when `Ctrl+C` is pressed. Instead of allowing the program to crash, the exception is caught, and the flag is set to return to the main menu.

   ```python
   except KeyboardInterrupt:
       print("\nReturning to the main menu...")
       return "main_menu"
   ```

4. **Main Loop Re-Entry**:
   - **Main Menu Re-display**: The main loop in `main.py` continuously checks the result of the `display_menu` method. If the method returns `"main_menu"`, it restarts the loop, causing the main menu to be displayed again.

   ```python
   while True:
       result = menu_manager.display_menu()
       if result == "main_menu":
           continue  # Redisplay the main menu
       break  # Exit the loop if the user chooses to exit
   ```

#### Explanation

- **Non-Terminating User Interruptions**: Instead of allowing `Ctrl+C` to terminate the application (as it typically would), the program traps the `KeyboardInterrupt` event and uses it to signal a controlled return to the main menu.
  
- **Decoupled and Flexible Design**: The use of a flag (`exit_to_main_menu`) and the `return` mechanism allows the control flow to be decoupled from specific menus. This ensures that the application can be extended with additional menus or actions without changing the interruption logic.

- **User Experience**: The user is provided with a smooth experience where they can safely interrupt any operation and return to the main menu, thus maintaining control over the application flow without unexpected exits.

This approach not only enhances user experience but also aligns with good software design practices by maintaining a clear separation of concerns and control flow in the application.
